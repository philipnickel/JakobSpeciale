# Data Directory

This directory contains data files generated by example scripts.

## Structure

Each example should create its own subdirectory:

```
data/
├── example_integration/
│   └── integration_results.parquet
└── your_example/
    └── your_data.parquet
```

## Note

Data files are typically generated by running the `compute.py` scripts in the `Examples/` directory.
