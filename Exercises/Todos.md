# Regarding convergence and sanity 
aliased vs dealiased. See Kouprianov Fig. 4.3
Possibly using semi-log plot?. See lecture on non-linear stuff S.28



# Dataframe format 
Columns: 
method, c, L, N, dt, t, dealias, x, u, M, V, E, u_exact, L2_err, Linf_err  


# Docs: 

## Better numpy style ish 


## sphinx-gallery for the plotting and data generation scripts 



# Ruff check and formatting


# Exercise a
1. How many evaluation points should we use in reference domain: See convergence data gen line 52 

# Exercise b
1. Is okay?
# Exercise c
# Exercise d
# Exercise e
1. Try to replicate the plots in L6 s.28 and 29
# Exercse f


# Structuring: 
- ex_a Done
- ex_b
- ex_c
- ex_d
- ex_e
- ex_f
